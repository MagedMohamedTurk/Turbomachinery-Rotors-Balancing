- [x] make scaled least squares method
  - [x] Objective cp.Minimize(cp.diag(scale) @ cp.sum_square(ALPHA@W+A))
  - [x] Scale vector[0, 0.5, 1.5] cancel sensor 1 and gives sensor 3 high importance
  - [ ] Make notebook for weighted least squares
  - [ ] Test Huber robust optimization
- [x] Add weight constrains
- [x] Make ALPHA class
- [x] Check if alpha passing to model is instance of ALpha class
- [x] spelling check for notebook.
- [ ] doc strings for all functions check
- [ ] package test
- [ ] Test least square with intial conditions
- [x] Refactor Alpha check method 
- [x] splitting
- [ ] try to make alpha three dimensions with conditions as third dimension.
- [ ] Change W to be row instead of column vector
- [ ] if W is None raise no solution
- [ ] replace custom error 
- [ ] Make package dependent tests
