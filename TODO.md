- [ ] make scaled least squares method
  - [ ] Objective cp.Minimize(cp.diag(scale) @ cp.sum_square(ALPHA@W+A))
  - [ ] Scale vector[0, 0.5, 1.5] cancel sensor 1 and gives sensor 3 high importance
- [x] Add weight constrains
- [x] Make ALPHA class
- [x] Check if alpha passing to model is instance of ALpha class
- [ ] spelling check for notebook.
- [ ] doc strings for all functions check
- [ ] package test
- [ ] Test least square with intial conditions
- [ ] Refactor Alpha check method 
- [ ] splitting
- [ ] try to make alpha three dimensions with conditions as third dimension.
